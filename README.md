# Flutter-Firebase-CRUD
This project is about basci operations of firebase in flutter.
I have tried to perform action show data, update data, delete data.
I have also implement here signin and login system using email address. 
Implemented the email verification page.
Till now it is working fine but I wanted to count child nodes for a spesific user
but I was unable to do that. If you can do that please let me know.
